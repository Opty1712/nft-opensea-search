# Cerulean Blue technical task

## Description

You are tasked to build a simple app to search for NFTs from [OpenSea API](https://docs.opensea.io/reference/api-overview).


Following are the steps to follow: 
- Connect to a Web3 Wallet, using [web3modal](https://github.com/Web3Modal/web3modal)
- Display your wallet's balance for two currencies namely, ETH and USDC
- Build a Search component, which uses OpenSeaAPI in order to fetch data
- Have interactive filters such as Cost, Date etc. to filter data
- Lastly make the layout mobile responsive and performant.

Note: This task has a 50% weightage towards Engineering and 50% weightage towards Design Aesthetics. 
Original Designs will be preferred, compared to out of the box UI library components.

Tech Stack: Use React.Js or Next.Js, alongside Material UI for components.

## Solution

Because `OpenSea API key` is not free, I used the `Moralis API` instead, therefore not all of the filters can be implemented.
